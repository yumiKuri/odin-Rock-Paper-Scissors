# odin-Rock-Paper-Scissors
his is a simple Rock–Paper–Scissors game built in JavaScript, running in the browser using prompt() and the console.

The project was intentionally straightforward for me, as I have prior experience in competitive programming. The focus was less on problem-solving and more on understanding JavaScript’s behavior in a browser environment.

## What I Learned

- JavaScript syntax and execution flow (a balance between Python’s flexibility and C’s structure)

- Function hoisting and execution order

- Debugging with browser Developer Tools and console.log()

- Handling every case of user input and string manipulation
